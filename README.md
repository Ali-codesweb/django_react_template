# Django React Integrated Template

This is a template which is combined of django and rect (with routers) to reduce the extra time of developer.



## Process

1. Clone the template. The template must be named "django_react_template".
2. Go to the "frontend" folder ( where the react project is situated ) and run 
```bash
  npm i
```
 and 
 ```bash 
 npm run build
 ```
3. Go back to the django main project folder ( where manage.py is situated ) and create a virtual environment by 
```bash 
virtualenv myenv
```
 ( if virtualenv is not installed then run 
 ```bash 
 pip install virtualenv
 ```
  and then run the command ).
4. In the same folder you must see a new folder named "myenv" which is essentially your virtual environment for python.
5. Then run 
```bash 
myenv\scripts\activate
```
 to activate the virtual environment and run 
 ```bash 
 pip install django
 ```
  to install django in the virtual environment.
6. Then run 
```bash 
python manage.py runserver
```
 to run the project.  


## To rename the project name

1. Firstly rename the root project name ( which will be "django_react_template" initially )

2. Then run 
```bash 
python manage.py renameproject old_name new_name
```
where old_name will essentially be "django_react_template" and new_name will be your desired name.
